# XO_game

Hello everyone ✨♥️

I am glad to share with you :-

My new project : XO game
programming language : QT C++

In this project i learned alot about GUI and using minimax in QT

features:-

1- you can choose if you want to play with player or with AI 
 
2- if you choose play with player the program asks you to enter your name and the name of the other player
and if you press play without enter your name ,  the name of the other player or both , An  message will appear tells you to enter your name 

3- after you play and the game over , a window will appear tells you who is winner or "Draw" in draw case

4-if you choose play with computer the program asks you to enter your name and if you press play without enter your name, An message will appear tells you to enter your name

5- and also after you play and the game over, a window will appear tells you who is winner or "Draw" in draw case


"play with computer"  has been implemented that it never loses either win or draw with player


Finally i am glad i finished this project and it is also good to practice on oop and minimax
